# Bayesian Personalized Ranking for MovieLens 1M Dataset with PyTorch

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook implementation of **Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)** applied to the **MovieLens 1M** dataset. The BPR approach is widely used in collaborative filtering to generate personalized rankings of items (movies in this case) for users, based on implicit feedback.

## Features
- **Device Agnostic:** The code can run on both **CPU** and **GPU**, making it adaptable to different hardware configurations.
- **Clear and Easy to Understand:** The notebook is well-documented with comments, ensuring that the code is easy to follow for users with different levels of expertise.

## Dataset
The notebook uses the [MovieLens 1M Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/), which consists of 1 million movie ratings from 6,000 users on 4,000 movies.
